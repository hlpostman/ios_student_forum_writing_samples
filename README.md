## iOS Writing

This repo contains a small selection answers I have written in
response to questions about iOS development for a StackOverflow-like
 forum.

All questions assume an informal tone and address a reader who faces a
specific problem and is new to iOS and Swift.  The reader may also be
 somewhat new to programming in general.

Each directory contains two files:

1. **REAMDE.md** - This file contains a very brief introduction to the main
 **answer.md** file
2. **answer.md** - This file contains the answer provided

The links in the **[Contents](#contents)** section below go directly to the
 **answer.md** file.
