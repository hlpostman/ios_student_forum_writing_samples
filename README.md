## iOS Writing

This repo contains a small selection answers I wrote while working for CodePath.  

During my time at CodePath, I monitored the iOS question-and-answer forum, writing many of the answers myself.  My average writing time was 1.5hrs/answer.

Here and there I've added some headers or corrected a typo to make the answer read more easily, but for the most part I have kept these answers as close as possible to their original form.

All questions assume an informal tone and address a reader who faces a
specific problem and is new to iOS and Swift.  The reader may also be
 somewhat new to programming in general.

Each directory contains two files:

1. **REAMDE.md** - This file contains a very brief introduction to the main
 **answer.md** file
2. **answer.md** - This file contains the answer provided

The links in the **[Contents](#contents)** section below go directly to the
 **answer.md** file.
