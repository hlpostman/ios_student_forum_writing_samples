This answer provides a fix for the various errors raised by the student's code.  Along the way, I walk the student through my debugging process to give an example of how they might approach these types of issues.  I explain some key points about Xcode and the particular errors raised.  Lastly, I give the student a hint on the issue they'll face once their app is running.

The student question is reproduced below, but does not provide much information.  I used additional conversations with the student and the student's repo as context.
