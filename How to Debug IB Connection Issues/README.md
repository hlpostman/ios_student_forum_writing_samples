It's easy to make bad outlet connections in the Xcode Interface Builder.  This answer addresses a general question (reproduced below) about how to debug these types of issues.

> Hi, so I keep getting this error when I try to click on a button to segue to another view controller. I know that this error has to do with an outlet that's not connected properly, but I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly where that issue is. From what I can tell, all of the outlet is properly connected with the correct name. I was wondering if there's a way to get more information about the error or the name of the outlet that's having the problem.
